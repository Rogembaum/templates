# Instructions
#
# A time period starting from "hh:mm" lasting until "hh:mm" is stored in an array:
#
# ["08:14", "11:34"]
#
# A set of different time periods is then stored in a 2D Array like so, each in its own sub-array:
#
# [["08:14","11:34"], ["08:16","08:18"], ["22:18","01:14"], ["09:30","10:32"], ["04:23","05:11"], ["11:48","13:48"], ["01:12","01:14"], ["01:13","08:15"]]
#
# Write a function that will take a 2D Array like the above as argument and return a 2D Array of the argument's sub-arrays sorted in ascending order.
#
# Take note of the following:
#
#     The first time period starts at the earliest time possible ("00:00"+).
#     The next time period is the one that starts the soonest after the prior time period finishes. If several time periods begin at the same hour, pick the first one showing up in the original array.
#     The next time period can start the same time the last one finishes.
#
# This:
#
# [["08:14","11:34"], ["08:16","08:18"], ["13:48","01:14"], ["09:30","10:32"], ["04:23","05:11"], ["11:48","13:48"], ["01:12","01:14"], ["01:13","08:15"]]
#
# Should return:
#
# [["01:12","01:14"], ["04:23","05:11"], ["08:14","11:34"], ["11:48","13:48"], ["13:48","01:14"], ["08:16","08:18"], ["09:30","10:32"], ["01:13","08:15"]]
